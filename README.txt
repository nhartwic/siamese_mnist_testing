This project was created to test the ability of Siamese neural networks to correctly class data when class wasn't present in training set. Test Plans:

1. Build a siamese neural network and train on whole MNIST N training set. Measure performance of network for each class
2. Create N-1 training sets which have 1 class removed from dataset. Measure performance of network for all classes. Compare performance to the "N training set" and compare performance of the networks on the N-1 classes to the Nth class
3. Create N-2 training sets which have 2 classes removed. Measure performance of networks for all classes. Compare performance to the "N training set" and to the N-1 Training sets.
